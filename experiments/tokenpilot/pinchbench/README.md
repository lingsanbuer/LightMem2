# PinchBench Experiments

This directory contains the PinchBench experiment harness for the current
LightMem2 runtime path.

At the current stage, the migration scope is intentionally narrow:

- dataset: `PinchBench` only
- settings: `isolated` and `continuous`
- active paths:
  - current LightMem2 method runs through the TokenPilot component
  - single-agent baseline runs

Out of scope for the first consolidation pass:

- baseline cleanup and revalidation
- `ClawEval`
- `FrontierScience`
- multi-agent / MAS variants
- legacy wrapper scripts that were only used for old ablations

This subtree documents the benchmark surface for the current public LightMem2
runtime release, where the TokenPilot component is the active context-management path.

The migration is now in an intermediate state:

- dataset tasks and assets have already been copied here
- dataset-side Python harness files have already been copied here
- the active single-agent method path now runs from this subtree
- the active single-agent baseline path now runs from this subtree

## Current Contents

- `docs/runtime-profile.md`
  - shared runtime profile used by the PinchBench method runs
- `docs/migration-scope.md`
  - keep/defer/drop inventory for the first merge pass
- `docs/layout-plan.md`
  - target subtree structure and directory ownership rules
- `dataset/`
  - current home for:
    - `tasks/`
    - `assets/` (downloaded locally from shared external storage)
    - `scripts/`
- `scripts/`
  - current home for the official baseline/method runners and shared helpers
- `run/`
  - local runner helpers; large logs/results should not be committed

## External data and result storage

Large PinchBench assets and produced result bundles are stored outside Git.

Google Drive root:

- <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AeMW693aMhyBKscUDbaxnrXfvE8aSBXg>

Recommended Drive layout for this benchmark:

```text
LightMem2/
└── TokenPilot/
    ├── experiment-data/
    │   └── pinchbench/
    │       └── assets/
    └── experiment-results/
        └── pinchbench/
            ├── isolated/
            └── continuous/
```

Local mount point for the input asset bundle:

- `experiments/tokenpilot/pinchbench/dataset/assets/`

Before running a fresh machine:

1. download `assets/` from Drive
2. copy the files into `dataset/assets/`
3. run the official baseline or method command
4. upload large result folders/logs to `experiment-results/pinchbench/`

## Official runners

The public runner surface is intentionally small:

- `scripts/run_baseline.sh`
- `scripts/run_method.sh`

These are the canonical entrypoints for open-source use.

### Baseline

Minimal isolated baseline run:

```bash
cd /path/to/LightMem2
bash experiments/tokenpilot/pinchbench/scripts/run_baseline.sh \
  --suite automated-only \
  --session-mode isolated \
  --model gpt-5.4-mini
```

### Method

Minimal isolated method run:

```bash
cd /path/to/LightMem2
bash experiments/tokenpilot/pinchbench/scripts/run_method.sh \
  --suite automated-only \
  --session-mode isolated \
  --model tokenpilot/gpt-5.4-mini
```

Continuous method run:

```bash
cd /path/to/LightMem2
bash experiments/tokenpilot/pinchbench/scripts/run_method.sh \
  --suite automated-only \
  --session-mode continuous \
  --model tokenpilot/gpt-5.4-mini
```

## Auxiliary runners

The following scripts remain useful, but they are not the primary public API:

- `scripts/run_experiment_matrix.sh`
  - batch orchestration over multiple baseline/method cases
- `scripts/run.sh`
  - convenience wrapper that launches the default experiment matrix

## Immediate Goal

The first real consolidation target is:

1. keep cleaning the migrated PinchBench wrapper surface
2. keep only:
   - PinchBench
   - isolated mode
   - continuous mode
   - single-agent method and baseline paths
3. defer MAS and other benchmark families until this active path is stable
